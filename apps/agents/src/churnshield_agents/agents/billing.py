"""30-day save confirmation + Stripe Connect billing.

Flow (product doc §3.1):
1. Find save_sessions where:
   - offer_accepted = true
   - outcome_confirmed_at is 30+ days ago   ← set immediately for pause/empathy;
                                               set by stripe_worker.handle_invoice_paid
                                               for extension/discount/downgrade
   - fee_billed_at IS NULL  (not yet charged)
   - fee_charged > 0
2. For each session, check Stripe that the subscription is still active.
3. If active  → charge fee via Stripe Connect application_fee on a PaymentIntent.
4. If churned → null out saved_value + fee_charged (save didn't hold).
5. Stamp fee_billed_at either way so we never revisit the row.

Fee basis and timing per offer type:
  pause      → 15% of full MRR    charged by stripe_worker on invoice.paid after pause ends
  empathy    → 15% of full MRR    charged by THIS sweep after 30 days
               No payment event to verify, so wait to confirm subscriber stayed.
  extension  → 15% of full MRR    charged immediately by stripe_worker on invoice.paid
  discount   → 15% of net MRR     charged immediately by stripe_worker on invoice.paid
  downgrade  → 15% of new plan MRR charged immediately by stripe_worker on invoice.paid
